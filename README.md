# Current-Project---Hexadecimal-to-pseudo-Assembly
The goal of this project is simple: Write a pseudo-assembly (aka my own language) assembler & disassembler in hexadecimal (starting with the latter)
As to why I'm going to do that, when it doesn't relate to my other projects, my applications, or even anything I'm studying, the answer is simple: I have no idea.
I mean, I was wondering how it worked, so I went 'Heh, we'll see'. There wasn't much more thought put into it.
But I swear it's fun, you should try too :)
BTW: The goal isn't to copy what's already available; it's to make partially low-high level (for example, native multiple operations such as (((a+b)%c)/d)*(a+b)
