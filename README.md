# Current-Project---Hexadecimal-to-pseudo-Assembly
Th goal of this project is simple: Learn about the way base assemblers work.
Working in hexadecimal, my goal is to write my first assembler in an Assembly inspired language, hopefully using my coding experience (which the creators of Assembly didn't have back then || couldn't put in place due to hardware limitations) to improve the user's experience (I'm realist enough to know that 'optimising' Assembly would be quite the impossible task, so I'd rather render it more usable)
